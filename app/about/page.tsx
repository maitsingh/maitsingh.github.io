          I study how power and inequality operate across space, using GIS, econometrics, and statistical modeling to examine access to political representation, labor markets, and public services.

          I make social systems visible while questioning the terms of their visibilityâ€”whether state surveys render informal workers legible for exploitation, electoral maps naturalize partisan clustering, or institutional metrics obscure structural inequities.

          I work with quantitative methods (spatial econometrics, predictive models) and critical theory (postcolonial studies, labor geography). The statistical analyses reveal patterns; the theoretical work asks why those patterns exist and what measuring them does politically. Some projects are data-driven inquiries. Others are essays interrogating how the state audits informality in labor or governance.
